Key Distributed Transaction Management Patterns

SAGA Pattern
Description: The SAGA pattern is a way of managing long-running distributed transactions by breaking them down into
smaller, local transactions. If one of the transactions fails, compensating actions are performed on the other services
to maintain consistency.
Variants:
Choreography-Based SAGA: Each service participates in the transaction by emitting and listening to events.
Orchestration-Based SAGA: A central orchestrator controls the flow of the transaction and compensates for failures.

Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Pattern
Description: 2PC is a classic pattern used for ensuring atomicity across distributed transactions. It involves two
phases:
Prepare Phase: The coordinator sends a "prepare" request to all participants. Each participant prepares to commit but
does not yet do so.
Commit Phase: Once all participants confirm they are ready to commit, the coordinator sends a "commit" signal, and
participants make the transaction permanent.
Challenges: 2PC is blocking, meaning that if a participant or the coordinator fails during the transaction, it may lead
to a blocked state, requiring a recovery process.
Use Case: Suitable for situations requiring strict atomicity and consistency, but it can be problematic in highly
distributed systems due to its blocking nature.

Three-Phase Commit (3PC) Pattern
Description: An extension of 2PC, 3PC introduces a third phase (the "pre-commit" phase) to address some of the
limitations of the 2PC protocol. It is designed to make the transaction more fault-tolerant by introducing additional
communication between the coordinator and participants.
Can Commit: The coordinator sends a "can commit" message to participants.
Pre-Commit: Participants send a "pre-commit" message, confirming they are ready to commit.
Commit: After receiving "pre-commit" from all participants, the coordinator sends a "commit" message.
Advantages: Non-blocking nature and more fault-tolerant than 2PC.
Challenges: Still relatively complex and not as widely adopted in modern distributed systems, particularly with
microservices where service failures and network partitions are more common.

Eventual Consistency Pattern
Description: Eventual consistency is a model where the system does not guarantee immediate consistency but ensures that,
given enough time, the system will eventually reach a consistent state. This pattern is commonly used in distributed
systems that prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency.
Example: Systems that use CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) or event sourcing can implement eventual
consistency by allowing changes to propagate asynchronously.
Use Case: Ideal for systems with high availability requirements where the application can tolerate temporary
inconsistencies (e.g., e-commerce platforms, social media applications).

Compensating Transaction Pattern
Description: This pattern is used to implement the SAGA pattern and involves defining specific compensating actions (or
rollback actions) that undo the effects of a transaction if an error occurs during a multi-step distributed transaction.
Example: If a service successfully creates an order but the payment service fails, a compensating transaction could
cancel the order.
Use Case: This pattern is useful in long-running transactions (like SAGA) where multiple microservices interact, and it
is necessary to handle failures by rolling back or compensating the previous successful actions.

TCC (Try-Confirm/Cancel) Pattern
Description: The TCC pattern divides a distributed transaction into three phases:
Try: Each service tries to perform its local transaction (e.g., reserves resources).
Confirm: If the Try phase is successful, the service confirms the transaction (e.g., commits the resources).
Cancel: If the Try phase fails or the process is aborted, the service cancels the transaction (e.g., releases the
resources).
Advantages: Provides fine-grained control and can be more reliable than 2PC.
Use Case: Useful in scenarios that require strong consistency and atomicity across services, and where compensating
actions are needed for rollback.
Reliable Messaging / Event-Driven Pattern

Description: This pattern involves using reliable message queues or event streams (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to ensure that
messages (or events) are reliably delivered across services and that each service's state is eventually consistent.
Example: In a payment process, if a payment service is temporarily unavailable, the order service will send an event to
a message queue, and the payment service will process the event once it’s back online.
Use Case: Common in event-driven architectures and systems that rely on asynchronous communication to maintain
consistency across distributed systems.

Idempotency Key Pattern
Description: This pattern ensures that even if a transaction is retried due to a failure or duplicate request, the
result will be the same, ensuring consistency. An idempotency key is sent with each request to identify the transaction
and guarantee the request’s results are applied only once.
Example: A user submits a payment; if the request is retried, the same idempotency key ensures that the payment is only
processed once.
Use Case: Useful in systems where operations can be retried (e.g., payments, order submissions) and you want to avoid
duplicate transactions.

Distributed Lock Pattern
Description: Distributed locks help coordinate and synchronize actions across distributed services to ensure that only
one instance of a service performs a specific task at a given time. This can help ensure consistency across services in
certain situations.
Example: A distributed lock can be used to manage inventory updates across multiple microservices to ensure only one
service is modifying the inventory at any given time.
Use Case: Ideal for preventing race conditions in systems that require synchronization, like updating inventory or
processing payments.

Message-based Communication Pattern
Description: Message-based communication relies on asynchronous messages sent between microservices to ensure
consistency and communication. Message queues, event buses, or topics can be used to propagate changes and synchronize
the services.
Example: In an e-commerce system, after a customer places an order, an event like OrderPlaced is sent to a message
queue, which is then processed by different microservices (inventory, shipping, payment).
Use Case: Effective in decoupling services and achieving eventual consistency in systems that handle asynchronous,
event-driven workflows.

Here is a list of distributed transaction management patterns:

SAGA Pattern: Breaks a transaction into smaller, independent transactions with compensating actions.
Two-Phase Commit (2PC): Ensures atomicity across multiple services in a distributed transaction.
Three-Phase Commit (3PC): Extends 2PC to make it non-blocking and more fault-tolerant.
Eventual Consistency: Ensures that data becomes consistent over time, useful when strong consistency isn't feasible.
Compensating Transaction: Defines specific actions to undo the work performed by a service if a failure occurs.
TCC (Try-Confirm/Cancel): Divides a transaction into Try, Confirm, and Cancel phases for more granular control.
Reliable Messaging / Event-Driven: Uses reliable messaging systems to ensure eventual consistency and fault tolerance.
Idempotency Key: Ensures that retrying a transaction does not cause duplication or inconsistencies.
Distributed Lock: Synchronizes tasks across services by using a distributed lock mechanism to avoid conflicts.
Message-based Communication: Uses messages or events to coordinate services and achieve eventual consistency.
