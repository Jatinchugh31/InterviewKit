What is a HashMap?
A HashMap<K, V> stores key-value pairs, allowing constant-time (O(1)) access in most cases.
It is not synchronized (not thread-safe).
Allows one null key and multiple null values.
It does not maintain insertion order (Unlike LinkedHashMap).


 Internal Working of HashMap
How does HashMap store key-value pairs?
Uses an array of Node<K, V> objects (buckets).
Computes a hash code to determine the index for storing the key-value pair.
Uses chaining (Linked List) or Red-Black Tree to handle collisions.

Load Factor and Resizing
Default initial capacity = 16
Default load factor = 0.75
Resizing occurs when size > (capacity × load factor).
Doubles capacity and recalculates indices.
