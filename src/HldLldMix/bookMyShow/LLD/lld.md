    BookingStatus status;
    Payment payment;
}
```

### 9. **Payment**

    PaymentMethod method;
}
```

### 10. **PaymentMethod**

Abstracts different payment methods.

```java
interface PaymentMethod {
    boolean pay(double amount);

    // Implementation details
}

class UpiPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### 11. **Notification**

Handles sending notifications to users.

```java
enum NotificationType { EMAIL, SMS }

class Notification {
    String notificationId;
    User user;
    String message;

## üõ†Ô∏è Services and Utilities

### 1. **SearchService**

## üìå Notes

* **Concurrency Handling**: Implement seat locking mechanisms to prevent double bookings.
* **Extensibility**: Use interfaces and abstract classes to allow easy addition of new features.
* **Design Patterns**: Utilize Strategy Pattern for payment methods and Observer Pattern for notifications.
