💻 As backend and microservices engineers, we often live in the world of APIs, Kafka, and databases — the Application Layer (Layer 7). But when things go wrong — latency, timeouts, broken streaming — the real answers often lie below the surface.



That’s where the OSI model’s 7 layers come in.

Here’s a quick breakdown:



🔹 Layer 7 – Application: REST, gRPC, Kafka, WebSockets, HTTP

🔹 Layer 6 – Presentation: JSON, XML, Protobuf, TLS/SSL

🔹 Layer 5 – Session: WebSocket handshakes, session tokens

🔹 Layer 4 – Transport: 🔥 TCP, UDP, QUIC ← The real MVP

🔹 Layer 3 – Network: IP, routing, firewalls

🔹 Layer 2 – Data Link: Ethernet, MAC addresses, ARP

🔹 Layer 1 – Physical: Cables, Wi-Fi, switches



🎯 Why Layer 4 (Transport) Deserves More Attention:

Layer 4 handles end-to-end delivery, ordering, error recovery, and connection control.



✔️ TCP – Reliable, ordered, connection-based (used in REST, gRPC, DBs)

✔️ UDP – Fast, connectionless, used in DNS, VoIP, live streams

✔️ QUIC – Modern, fast, secure protocol built over UDP (used in HTTP/3)

⚠️ QUIC is replacing TCP in many places — think YouTube, Gmail, Google Search



Many engineers mistake tools like WebRTC, gRPC, or DASH for transport protocols — but they all ride on top of TCP/UDP.



🔍 When you debug latency or streaming issues, Layer 4 is where the real bottlenecks or optimizations often lie.
