Summary of Comparison:
Method                     Type of Communication Protocol Bidirectional Use Case Implementation Complexity
Long Polling                One-way, client to server HTTP No Real-time notifications, chat systems Moderate
WebSockets                  Full-duplex, client to server WebSocket Yes Chat apps, real-time notifications Moderate to High
Server-Sent Events One-way, server to client HTTP (SSE)    No Notifications, live updates Low
HTTP Polling                One-way, client to server HTTP No Periodic updates Low
MQTT Publish/Subscribe MQTT Yes IoT, device messaging, dashboards Moderate
GraphQL Subscriptions One-way, client to server WebSocket/HTTP Yes Real-time data with GraphQL Moderate to High
gRPC Full-duplex, client to server gRPC Yes Microservices, high-performance systems High



long pooling clinet send the resquest , connection will be open for some time  when server get data it will send else timeout 

webcoket ->> biderectional connection    any one can send messae 

server sent event only   one connection will be for each client request and server can send back 
    clinet can't use same connection 

http polling  one way cline send request and check for n ew data 
grapql is also one way and request for specific data out of full response
