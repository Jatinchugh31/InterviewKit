Absolutely! **Design principles** are foundational guidelines that help you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Here are some of the most important and widely recognized ones:

---

## **Key Design Principles (with Simple Explanations)**

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* **Each class or method should have only one reason to change.**
* Example: Don’t mix database logic and UI logic in the same class.

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle**

* **Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.**
* You should be able to add new behavior without modifying existing code (e.g., using inheritance or interfaces).

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**

* **Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.**
* If class B is a subclass of A, you should be able to use B wherever you use A, without unexpected results.

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle**

* **Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.**
* Split large interfaces into smaller, specific ones.

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**

* **Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.**
* Use interfaces or abstract classes so your code is less tightly coupled.

> These five principles together are often remembered as the **SOLID principles**.

### 6. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**

* **Avoid duplicating code or logic.**
* Reuse code via methods, classes, or modules.

### 7. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

* **Simplicity beats complexity.**
* Don’t over-engineer solutions; keep your code as simple as possible.

### 8. **YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)**

* **Don’t implement something until it is necessary.**
* Avoid adding features just because you think you might need them later.

### 9. **Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)**

* **A module should not know about the inner details of the objects it interacts with.**
* "Talk to friends, not to strangers."

### 10. **Composition Over Inheritance**

* **Favor composing objects with simple functionalities over inheriting from base classes.**
* Promotes flexibility and code reuse.

| Principle                    | Core Idea                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SRP                          | One responsibility per class/module         |
| Open/Closed                  | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| Liskov Substitution          | Subtypes replace parent types seamlessly    |
| Interface Segregation        | No fat interfaces, only what is needed      |
| Dependency Inversion         | Depend on abstractions, not concretes       |
| DRY                          | No code duplication                         |
| KISS                         | Keep code simple                            |
| YAGNI                        | Don’t code what you don’t need              |
| Law of Demeter               | Low coupling; talk to friends only          |
| Composition over Inheritance | Prefer composition to deep inheritance      |
