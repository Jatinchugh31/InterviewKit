Sure! Let me give you a more complex SQL query with various clauses like `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and some aggregate functions. I'll then explain the order of operations for each part of the query.

### Example of a Complex Query:

```sql
SELECT c.name AS city_name, co.name AS country_name, COUNT(r.id) AS reviews_count, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM city c
JOIN country co ON c.countryCode = co.code
LEFT JOIN review r ON c.id = r.cityId
WHERE co.name = 'Germany' AND c.population > 500000
GROUP BY c.name, co.name
HAVING COUNT(r.id) > 10 AND AVG(r.rating) > 4
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, reviews_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Query Breakdown:

#### 1. **FROM / JOIN**:

* The query starts by selecting data from the **city** table (aliased as `c`).
* Then, a **JOIN** is performed between the **city** and **country** tables based on the condition `c.countryCode = co.code`. This means we're joining the cities with their corresponding countries.
* After that, a **LEFT JOIN** is performed between the **city** and **review** tables, where `c.id = r.cityId`. The **LEFT JOIN** ensures that even cities with no reviews are included, with `NULL` values for the review columns.

#### 2. **WHERE**:

* The **WHERE** clause filters the data based on the following conditions:

    * The country name must be `'Germany'`.
    * The city's population must be greater than 500,000.
* So, it only keeps cities in Germany with a population over 500,000.

#### 3. **GROUP BY**:

* The query groups the data by `c.name` (city name) and `co.name` (country name).
* This means it will create groups of rows where each group represents a unique combination of city and country.

#### 4. **HAVING**:

* The **HAVING** clause is used to filter the groups (created by **GROUP BY**) based on conditions applied to the aggregated data.
* Here, it filters the results to include only:

    * Cities with more than 10 reviews (based on `COUNT(r.id)`).
    * Cities with an average rating higher than 4 (based on `AVG(r.rating)`).

#### 5. **SELECT**:

* After grouping and filtering, the **SELECT** clause defines which columns to return in the final result:

    * `c.name AS city_name`: City name from the **city** table.
    * `co.name AS country_name`: Country name from the **country** table.
    * `COUNT(r.id) AS reviews_count`: The total number of reviews for each city.
    * `AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating`: The average rating for each city.

#### 6. **ORDER BY**:

* The **ORDER BY** clause sorts the result set by `avg_rating` in descending order (`DESC`) first.
* If multiple cities have the same average rating, it will then sort those cities by `reviews_count` in descending order.

#### 7. **LIMIT**:

* Finally, the **LIMIT 5** restricts the result to only the top 5 cities after sorting.

### Order of Operations:

1. **FROM / JOIN**:

    * The query starts by identifying the tables to work with and joining them. It combines the data from the **city**, **country**, and **review** tables.

2. **WHERE**:

    * After the tables are joined, the query applies the **WHERE** clause to filter the rows that match the conditions: the country is `'Germany'` and the city population is greater than 500,000.

3. **GROUP BY**:

    * After filtering, the data is grouped by `city.name` and `country.name`. This forms the basis for performing aggregations on the grouped data.

4. **HAVING**:

    * After the groups are created, the **HAVING** clause is applied to filter out the groups based on aggregated values. Only groups with more than 10 reviews and an average rating greater than 4 are kept.

5. **SELECT**:

    * The **SELECT** clause is applied to define the final columns that will appear in the result set. This includes the city name, country name, the count of reviews, and the average rating.

6. **ORDER BY**:

    * The query then sorts the result set first by `avg_rating` in descending order, and if there are ties, by `reviews_count` in descending order.

7. **LIMIT**:

    * Finally, the query limits the number of rows returned to the top 5 cities after sorting.

### Summary of the Evaluation Order:

1. **FROM / JOIN**: Combine the tables together.
2. **WHERE**: Filter the rows.
3. **GROUP BY**: Group the data by city and country.
4. **HAVING**: Filter the grouped data based on aggregated values.
5. **SELECT**: Retrieve the columns specified in the query.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sort the result set.
7. **LIMIT**: Limit the number of rows returned.

This query involves multiple steps, and understanding the order of operations is crucial for writing efficient SQL queries and predicting how results will be filtered and aggregated.
