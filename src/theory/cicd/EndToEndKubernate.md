# 🧭 How a Request Reaches a Kubernetes Pod (`www.myapp.com`)

## ✅ High-Level Request Flow (Cloud Setup)

```text
User → DNS → External Load Balancer → Ingress Controller → Kubernetes Service → Pod (Container)
```

---

## 🧱 Detailed Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. 🌍 **User Request**

* User opens `www.myapp.com` in a browser.
* DNS resolves `www.myapp.com` to an **external IP**.

---

### 2. 🌐 **External Load Balancer**

* Provided by the **cloud provider** (e.g., AWS ELB, GCP Load Balancer).
* This forwards traffic to the **Ingress Controller Service**.

---

### 3. 🚏 **Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik)**

* Runs as a **Pod inside the cluster**.
* Uses defined **Ingress rules** to route traffic based on:

    * Hostname (e.g., `www.myapp.com`)
    * Path (e.g., `/api`, `/admin`)
* Forwards request to the correct **Kubernetes Service**.

---

### 4. 🎯 **Kubernetes Service**

* Service maps to one or more **Pods** using **label selectors**.
* Internally load balances traffic using **iptables or IPVS**.
* Types of Services:

    * `ClusterIP` (default, internal only)
    * `NodePort` (exposes on node IP + port)
    * `LoadBalancer` (used in cloud environments)

---

### 5. 🐳 **Pod**

* The request finally lands on the **Pod** running your app container.

---

## 🔄 Alternate Flow (Non-Cloud / Bare Metal)

In environments without a cloud LB, the flow involves **NodePort**:

```text
User → Node IP + NodePort → Ingress Controller Pod → Service → Pod
```

### 🔹 What is `NodePort`?

* A type of Service that exposes a specific port on all K8s nodes.
* Used in **on-prem, Minikube, or bare-metal** setups.
* Example: Expose Ingress Controller on port `30080`.

## 📝 Summary Table

| Step | Cloud Setup                 | Bare Metal / Minikube Setup     |
|------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1    | DNS resolves to LB IP       | DNS resolves to Node IP         |
| 2    | Cloud LoadBalancer forwards | User sends to `NodeIP:NodePort` |
| 3    | Ingress Controller Pod      | Ingress Controller Pod          |
| 4    | Service (ClusterIP)         | Service (ClusterIP)             |
| 5    | Pod (Container)             | Pod (Container)                 |

---

## ✅ Bonus Notes

* **Ingress Controller** = Smart Layer 7 router (like NGINX or Traefik)
* **NodePort** = Useful in dev/local clusters without a LoadBalancer
* **kube-proxy** = Sets up routing rules on nodes using iptables/IPVS
