sumary 
if we have less partition in the topic and more consume in the group ,   that can raise a issue of laggin 

if we have  good number for topics ,but all the data is goind in one partitioan   that 
use proper partion key 

if consumer service  is process message slow -> use async 

 we have huge data par reading data sequentially -> we need to use batching 
 
insufficiant hardware store

if sudden  traffic increase new consumer will be added which will do some rebalancing  so that can increase lag
