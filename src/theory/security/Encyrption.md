Great question. Let's break it down step by step:

---

## 🔐 If You Are the Client and I Am the Server

We want to **securely send data** between us (usually from the server to the client or vice versa). To do that, we often
use **asymmetric encryption** during the initial setup, and **symmetric encryption** for the actual data transfer (like
HTTPS).

---

## 🧠 Asymmetric Encryption Basics

* **Public Key** – can be shared with anyone.
* **Private Key** – must be kept secret.

They work together:

* Data encrypted with the **public key** can only be decrypted with the **private key**, and vice versa.
* Asymmetric encryption is slow, so it's mainly used to **establish trust and share symmetric keys**.

---

## 🔐 Who Keeps the Private Key?

* **The Server** (me, in this case) **keeps the private key** securely.
* The **client (you)** get the **public key**.

### Example with HTTPS (real-world scenario):

1. **Server has a public/private key pair** (used in SSL/TLS certificates).
2. **Client connects to server** and gets the **server's public key**.
3. **Client uses server’s public key** to encrypt a randomly generated **symmetric key**.
4. Server receives the encrypted symmetric key and **decrypts it using its private key**.
5. Now both sides use that symmetric key to **encrypt/decrypt actual data** (faster and more efficient).

## 🔁 Summary

| Role   | Key Type                                        | What Happens                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Server | Private                                         | Keeps it secret; decrypts messages       |
| Server | Public                                          | Shares it with client                    |
| Client | Public                                          | Uses it to encrypt a session key/message |
| Client | No private key needed (in basic HTTPS scenario) |                                          |

In more advanced cases (like mutual TLS or secure messaging apps), the client might also have a key pair.
