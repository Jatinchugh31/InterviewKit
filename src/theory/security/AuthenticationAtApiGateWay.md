Sure! Here’s an updated LinkedIn post draft with an example config included:

💡 **Everyone says “put authentication in the API Gateway!” – but have you ever thought about *how* to actually do it?**
💡

When deploying apps in Kubernetes, a lot of us use **Ingress** resources to expose services. But did you know that’s
only **half** of the story?

🔍 **Ingress** in Kubernetes is just a set of rules: it defines **what** should be exposed, but not **how** traffic is
managed. That’s where the **Ingress Controller** (like the popular **NGINX Ingress Controller**)
comes in – it takes those rules and turns them into actual routing and security logic.

👉 **So what about authentication?**
Most of us just say:
✅ “Let the API Gateway handle it!”
But in practice, with NGINX Ingress, you have options like:
🔸 **Basic Authentication** (via annotations + Kubernetes Secret)
🔸 **External OAuth2 Proxy** (like oauth2-proxy for OAuth2/OIDC support)
🔸 **JWT Validation** (for more advanced needs)

🔧 **Here’s an example with `oauth2-proxy` and NGINX Ingress annotations**:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "https://auth.example.com/oauth2/auth"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://auth.example.com/oauth2/start?rd=$request_uri"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: my-app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

This setup **redirects unauthenticated users** to your OAuth2 provider (like Google, GitHub, Okta). 🔒

🔗 Let’s move past the buzzwords and start implementing robust authentication flows **at the Ingress layer** – because
security is only real when it’s practical! 🔥
