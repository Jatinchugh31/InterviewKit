Here are five interview questions related to securing a Spring Boot application along with an explanation for each:

1. How can you secure a Spring Boot application from common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)?
   Explanation: This question assesses your knowledge of general security best practices and how they can be implemented
   in Spring Boot applications. To secure against SQL injection, you should use Prepared Statements via Spring Data JPA,
   JDBC templates, or HQL/JPQL to avoid raw SQL queries. For preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), make use of HTML
   escaping (e.g., Thymeleaf provides automatic escaping of HTML), and input validation/sanitization.

Follow-up: You can discuss other Spring Security features like CSRF protection, input validation, and secure coding
practices.

2. What is Spring Security, and how does it help in securing a Spring Boot application?
   Explanation: This question evaluates your understanding of Spring Security, which is a powerful and customizable
   authentication and access-control framework for Java applications. Spring Security helps secure a Spring Boot app by
   providing:

Authentication and Authorization: It helps manage user login, roles, and permissions (e.g., through JWT, OAuth2, or
LDAP).
Secure Communication: It can enforce SSL and HTTPS.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: It helps mitigate CSRF attacks by generating tokens.
Session Management: Controls user sessions, preventing session fixation attacks.
Follow-up: You could be asked about specific components of Spring Security, such as @PreAuthorize, method security
annotations, or how to configure Spring Security with different authentication mechanisms (e.g., database, OAuth2, or
JWT).

3. How would you implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Spring Boot application using Spring Security?
   Explanation: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows the application to restrict access to specific resources based
   on user roles (e.g., admin, user). In Spring Boot, you can implement RBAC by:

Defining roles in your database and associating them with user accounts.
Using Spring Security annotations like @PreAuthorize, @Secured, or @RolesAllowed to restrict access at the method level.
Configuring HTTP security to restrict access to certain endpoints based on roles (http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("
/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")).
Follow-up: You may be asked how to manage permissions for more granular control (e.g., permissions vs. roles) or how to
handle complex policies (e.g., dynamic access control using ACLs).

4. How do you handle authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)?
   Explanation: JWT is commonly used for stateless authentication in modern web applications. To implement JWT in Spring
   Boot:

You typically implement a custom filter (e.g., JwtAuthenticationFilter) to intercept requests and validate the JWT token
in the Authorization header.
You can create a JWT utility class for generating and validating tokens.
Upon successful authentication, JWT can be used to store user information (e.g., roles) and verify the user's identity
for subsequent requests without needing to store session information.
Spring Security filters can be integrated into the security configuration to enforce JWT validation on secured
endpoints.
Follow-up: A follow-up might be on handling token expiration, token refresh mechanisms, and the trade-offs between JWT
and traditional session-based authentication.

5. How can you secure sensitive data in a Spring Boot application (e.g., passwords, API keys, database credentials)?
   Explanation: This question evaluates how you handle sensitive data in a Spring Boot application. Key strategies
   include:

Password Hashing: Use BCrypt or PBKDF2 for password hashing and Salting to prevent dictionary attacks.
Environment Variables: Store sensitive information like API keys or database credentials in environment variables or
Spring Cloud Config to avoid hardcoding them in source code.
Encryption: Use AES encryption for data at rest or TLS (HTTPS) for data in transit.
Spring Boot Properties Encryption: Use Spring Boot's support for jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) to encrypt
sensitive properties in application.properties or application.yml.
Follow-up: You might be asked about best practices for securing Spring Boot application properties (e.g., using Spring
Cloud Vault for managing secrets) or how to implement secure communications through SSL/TLS.
