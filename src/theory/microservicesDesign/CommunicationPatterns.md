These patterns help manage how microservices interact with each other.

Synchronous Communication Pattern:

Description: In this pattern, services communicate directly with each other in real time using protocols such as HTTP or
gRPC. The client waits for a response before continuing its execution.
Use Case: This pattern is useful when real-time interaction is necessary, such as when one service depends on the
immediate result of another.

Asynchronous Communication Pattern:
Description: Microservices communicate through events or messages, typically using message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ,
or AWS SNS. Services don't wait for a direct response; instead, they react to events or messages.
Use Case: Ideal for loose coupling between services, improving performance and fault tolerance. Asynchronous
communication is useful for scenarios like task queues, event-driven systems, and decoupled services.

Request-Reply Pattern:
Description: A specific case of synchronous communication where a service sends a request to another service and expects
a reply. This is common in RPC systems (Remote Procedure Call).
Use Case: Used for synchronous service communication where a response is expected right away.

Publish-Subscribe Pattern:
Description: A service can publish an event or message, and multiple subscribers can listen and react to it. This is
often done through message brokers and can be used to decouple services.
Use Case: Good for event-driven systems, where many services need to listen to changes or updates in a system.
