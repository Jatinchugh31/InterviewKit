Phaser is a concurrency utility in Java that provides a way to synchronize multiple threads. It is part of the
`java.util.concurrent` package, introduced in Java 7. It helps manage a group of threads that need to wait for each
other to reach a certain point in their execution before continuing. This is commonly used in scenarios where you have
multiple threads performing independent tasks, and you want to ensure they synchronize at certain stages.

Phaser is often considered a more flexible alternative to other synchronization mechanisms like `CountDownLatch` or
`CyclicBarrier`, as it allows more fine-grained control over the synchronization process. With Phaser, you can register
and deregister threads dynamically, control phases (stages of execution), and use features like pausing threads during
different phases of execution.

### Key Concepts

1. **Phases**: The execution of threads is divided into phases. Each thread can be synchronized at the end of a phase,
   meaning it waits for all other threads to reach the same phase before proceeding.

2. **Registering Threads**: You can register threads (or parties) to participate in the synchronization process. Threads
   that reach the synchronization point are called "parties."

3. **Dynamic Registration**: Unlike `CyclicBarrier` or `CountDownLatch`, which use a fixed number of parties, Phaser
   allows dynamic registration and deregistration of threads, making it more flexible for different types of parallel
   execution patterns.

4. **Synchronization Mechanism**: Threads wait for others to reach a common point (phase) in their execution. Once all
   threads in the phase have arrived, they can all proceed to the next phase.

5. **Methods**:

    * `register()`: Registers a new thread (or party) to the Phaser.
    * `arrive()`: Indicates that a thread has reached the synchronization point for the current phase.
    * `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()`: Makes the thread arrive at the current phase and waits for others to arrive before
      proceeding to the next phase.
    * `arriveAndDeregister()`: Marks the thread's completion for the current phase and deregisters it from further
      participation.
    * `awaitAdvance(phase)`: Waits for all registered threads to reach the specified phase.

### Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Phaser;

public class PhaserExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // Register the main thread

        // Creating worker threads
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            new Thread(new Worker(phaser), "Worker-" + i).start();
        }

        // Main thread waits for all workers to complete the first phase
        phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
        System.out.println("All workers have reached the first phase!");

        // Main thread continues its work after phase synchronization
    }

    static class Worker implements Runnable {
        private final Phaser phaser;

        Worker(Phaser phaser) {
            this.phaser = phaser;
            phaser.register(); // Register each worker thread
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is working on phase 1");
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
                phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // Wait for all other threads in phase 1

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is working on phase 2");
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
                phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // Wait for all other threads in phase 2
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Dynamic Registration**: The `Phaser` class allows for dynamic registration of threads, meaning you can register
   additional threads at any point.

2. **Multiple Phases**: A phase is simply a point in time where all registered threads must reach before they can
   proceed. The threads are all synchronized on these phases.

3. **Flexibility**: Unlike `CyclicBarrier` (which can only be used in a fixed-size scenario), `Phaser` can be used in
   more complex and variable thread count scenarios because it allows for registration and deregistration of threads.

4. **Performance Considerations**: Since `Phaser` offers more flexibility and dynamic control over threads than
   `CyclicBarrier` and `CountDownLatch`, it can be particularly useful for advanced use cases with complex concurrency
   needs.

### When to Use Phaser:

* **Multiple Phases of Work**: When multiple threads need to synchronize at different phases during their execution.
* **Dynamic Threads**: When the number of threads is not known ahead of time, or threads are added and removed
  dynamically.
* **Flexible Synchronization**: If you need more complex synchronization than what `CountDownLatch` or `CyclicBarrier`
  can provide.

### Limitations:

* `Phaser` has a slightly higher overhead compared to simpler synchronization mechanisms like `CountDownLatch` or
  `CyclicBarrier`, but it offers greater flexibility, which can be useful in more complex scenarios.
