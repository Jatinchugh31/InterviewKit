Certainly! Here's a polished and professional LinkedIn post explaining `final Object mutex` and how synchronized access works with it—tailored for developers who want to deepen their understanding of Java synchronization:

🧵 **Ever wondered how `Collections.synchronizedMap()` ensures thread-safe access?**

Under the hood, it’s all about **mutex-based synchronization**.

You might see something like:

```java
final Object mutex;
```

This `mutex` acts as the **monitor object**—the core mechanism that all synchronized methods or blocks use to manage thread access.

Take this method:

```java
public int size() {
    synchronized (mutex) {
        return m.size();
    }
}
```

💡 Here’s what happens:

* `Thread-1` calls `size()` and enters the `synchronized(mutex)` block.
* It **acquires the lock** on the `mutex` object and proceeds.
* If `Thread-2` tries to access `size()` at the same time, it’s **blocked** until `Thread-1` releases the lock.
* Once `Thread-1` exits, the lock is released and `Thread-2` continues.

This guarantees:
✔️ **Mutual exclusion**
✔️ **Safe memory visibility** between threads

🚫 Why not just use `synchronized(this)`?
Because the wrapper class may be exposed to multiple threads directly. Using a dedicated `mutex` object gives **tighter control** and avoids unintended lock interference.

🔐 Pro tip: Always manually synchronize on the map when doing **compound actions** (like iteration), even with `Collections.synchronizedMap()`.

```java
synchronized (syncMap) {
    for (Map.Entry<?, ?> e : syncMap.entrySet()) {
        // safe iteration
    }
}
```

🧠 Understanding these fundamentals helps you build more **predictable, robust** concurrent systems.
