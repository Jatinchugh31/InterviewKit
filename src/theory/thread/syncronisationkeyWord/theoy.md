In Java, synchronization is used to control the access of multiple threads to a shared resource. It ensures that only
one thread can access the synchronized block of code at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

The `synchronized` keyword in Java can be applied at different levels, namely **object level**, **method level**, and *
*class level**. Let's go through each of these in detail.

### 1. **Synchronization at the Object Level**

At the object level, synchronization is used to ensure that only one thread can access a particular instance method or
block of code in an object at a time. This means that if multiple threads are trying to access the synchronized method
or block of the same object, only one thread can execute it at a time.

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        // Thread 1
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        // Thread 2
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- The `increment` method is synchronized, so when one thread calls this method, it locks the `Counter` object,
  preventing any other thread from accessing the `increment` method of the same object until the lock is released.
- This ensures that the count is updated safely and avoids race conditions.

### 2. **Synchronization at the Method Level**

Synchronization at the method level involves using the `synchronized` keyword on an entire method, which allows only one
thread to execute that method at a time for the current object. This is the most common usage of synchronization.

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized void decrement() {
        count--;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- In the example above, the methods `increment()` and `decrement()` are synchronized. If one thread is executing
  `increment()`, no other thread can enter any of the synchronized methods of the same `Counter` object until the first
  thread finishes its execution.

### 3. **Synchronization at the Class Level**

When synchronization is applied at the **class level**, it locks the entire class rather than a particular object
instance. This is done by using `synchronized` on a static method or block. This means that all threads accessing
synchronized static methods of the class will be able to access only one method at a time, even if they are operating on
different instances of the class.

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    // Synchronized static method
    public static synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static synchronized void decrement() {
        count--;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Thread 1
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                Counter.increment();
            }
        });

        // Thread 2
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                Counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- The methods `increment()` and `decrement()` are synchronized at the **class level**. Even though these methods are
  static, the synchronization works across all threads trying to access them, meaning only one thread can access a
  synchronized static method at any time, even if the threads are operating on different instances of the `Counter`
  class.

### Key Differences Between Object Level and Class Level Synchronization

- **Object-Level Synchronization**:
    - It synchronizes access to methods on a specific instance (object) of the class. Multiple threads can access
      synchronized methods of different objects concurrently, but only one thread can access the synchronized method of
      the same object at a time.

- **Class-Level Synchronization**:
    - It synchronizes access to static methods or static blocks in the entire class. If a static synchronized method is
      accessed by one thread, no other thread can access any static synchronized method of that class, regardless of the
      object instance.

### 4. **Synchronization with Code Blocks**

You can also synchronize a specific block of code inside a method rather than synchronizing the entire method. This
allows for more fine-grained control over which parts of the code should be thread-safe.

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {  // Synchronize only this block
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- Here, only the `count++` operation is synchronized, and it is synchronized on the current object (`this`). This means
  only one thread can execute this block for the same object at any time, but other methods of the `Counter` object can
  still run concurrently if they are not synchronized.

### Summary of Different Levels of Synchronization:

- **Object-level synchronization**: `synchronized` applied to instance methods or blocks. The lock is on the current
  object (`this`), and only one thread can access the synchronized method/block for a particular object.
- **Method-level synchronization**: The entire method is synchronized, and only one thread can execute the synchronized
  method for the current object at a time.
- **Class-level synchronization**: `synchronized` applied to static methods or blocks. The lock is on the class itself,
  and no other thread can execute any static synchronized method of the class at a time.

### Conclusion:

Synchronization is crucial in multi-threaded environments to prevent data inconsistency and race conditions. Depending
on the level of synchronization you need (object-level, method-level, or class-level), you can apply the `synchronized`
keyword accordingly.

No, the two synchronization blocks you mentioned are **not the same**. They differ in what they are synchronizing on,
which has important implications for thread synchronization and locking behavior. Here's the distinction between the
two:

### 1. **`synchronized(this)`**

```java
synchronized(this){
count++;
        }
```

- **What is synchronized?**
    - This synchronizes the block of code on the **current instance** (the object instance on which the method or block
      is called). The lock is applied to the object that is invoking the method or code block.

- **When is it used?**
    - You use `synchronized(this)` when you want to ensure that only one thread can execute the synchronized block for
      the **current instance** of the object.

- **Example**: If you have multiple instances of the `Counter` class, each instance will have its own lock. Threads
  working on different instances can execute the synchronized block concurrently. However, threads working on the same
  instance will be blocked until the first thread releases the lock.

- **Use case**: When you want to protect shared data at the object level (i.e., synchronization is needed for a
  particular object instance).

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {  // Synchronize on the current object instance
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, two different threads that are operating on **different instances** of `Counter` can execute the
synchronized block concurrently. However, if two threads are working on the **same instance** of `Counter`, one will
have to wait until the other finishes.

### 2. **`synchronized(Counter.class)`**

```java
synchronized(Counter .class){
count++;
        }
```

- **What is synchronized?**
    - This synchronizes the block of code on the **class object** (`Counter.class`). The lock is applied to the
      `Counter.class` object, which is shared across all instances of the class.

- **When is it used?**
    - You use `synchronized(Counter.class)` when you want to ensure that only one thread can execute the synchronized
      block for the **entire class**, regardless of the instance.

- **Example**: This means that if multiple threads are accessing a synchronized block of code in **any instance** of the
  `Counter` class, they will all be blocked and only one thread will be allowed to execute the synchronized block at a
  time. It is a "class-level lock" because it synchronizes the code based on the class object, not the individual object
  instances.

- **Use case**: When you want to protect shared resources that are class-level (i.e., static variables or methods) or
  when you want to synchronize across all instances of a class.

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    public static void increment() {
        synchronized (Counter.class) {  // Synchronize on the class object
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, the lock is on the `Counter.class` object, which is shared across all instances of the `Counter` class.
Even if different threads are working on different instances of `Counter`, they will still be blocked from executing the
`increment()` method simultaneously because the lock is on the class, not the instance.

### Summary of Key Differences:

| Aspect                       | `synchronized(this)`                                                                                                  | `synchronized(Counter.class)`                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is locked?**          | Lock is on the **current instance** (object level).                                                                   | Lock is on the **class object** (class level).                                                                 |
| **Level of synchronization** | **Object-level synchronization** – One thread can access the synchronized block for a specific instance of the class. | **Class-level synchronization** – One thread can access the synchronized block for all instances of the class. |
| **Scope**                    | Only threads operating on the same instance are blocked. Threads operating on different instances are not blocked.    | Threads across all instances of the class are blocked from entering the synchronized block at the same time.   |
| **Use case**                 | For synchronization on instance-level data.                                                                           | For synchronization on class-level data or across all instances.                                               |

### When to Use Which:

- **`synchronized(this)`**: Use when you need to synchronize access to instance-specific data (i.e., instance variables)
  so that only one thread can access that data at a time for a specific object instance.
- **`synchronized(Counter.class)`**: Use when you need to synchronize access to class-level data (i.e., static variables
  or methods), or when you want to ensure only one thread can execute a block of code across all instances of a class.

### Conclusion:

- **`synchronized(this)`** operates at the **object level**, meaning that each object has its own lock.
- **`synchronized(Counter.class)`** operates at the **class level**, meaning that the lock is shared among all instances
  of the `Counter` class.
