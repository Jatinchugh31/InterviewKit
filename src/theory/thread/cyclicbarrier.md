A **CyclicBarrier** in Java is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a
common barrier point. It is called "cyclic" because it can be reused once the waiting threads are released.

The `CyclicBarrier` class is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and can be used when you have a fixed number of
threads that must all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point before any of them can proceed.

### How it works:

1. You define a `CyclicBarrier` with a certain number of threads, called the "parties."
2. Each thread calls the `await()` method, which blocks until all the threads have reached the barrier point.
3. Once all threads have called `await()`, they are released to continue their execution.
4. The barrier can be reused after all threads have been released.

### Code Example:

Let's look at a simple example where multiple threads must wait for each other at a barrier and then proceed.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class CyclicBarrierExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Number of threads that must wait at the barrier
        int numberOfThreads = 5;

        // Create a CyclicBarrier, passing the number of parties (threads) required
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfThreads, new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                // This will execute once all threads reach the barrier
                System.out.println("All threads have reached the barrier, let's proceed!");
            }
        });

        // Create and start the threads
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
            new Thread(new Worker(barrier)).start();
        }
    }
}

class Worker implements Runnable {
    private CyclicBarrier barrier;

    public Worker(CyclicBarrier barrier) {
        this.barrier = barrier;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            // Simulating some work before reaching the barrier
            Thread.sleep((int) (Math.random() * 1000));
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reached the barrier");

            // Await at the barrier until all threads reach this point
            barrier.await();

            // After all threads have reached the barrier, continue with the rest of the work
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is continuing execution after the barrier");
        } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **CyclicBarrier Initialization**:

    * We create a `CyclicBarrier` with a specified number of parties (`numberOfThreads = 5` in this example).
    * A `Runnable` is passed to the `CyclicBarrier` constructor. This `Runnable` will be executed once all the threads
      reach the barrier. It prints a message indicating that all threads have reached the barrier and can proceed.

2. **Thread Creation**:

    * We start 5 threads (one for each party). Each thread simulates some work (using `Thread.sleep()`), then calls
      `barrier.await()` to wait for the other threads to reach the barrier.

3. **Thread Synchronization**:

    * Once all 5 threads reach the barrier, the barrier releases them to proceed with their execution. This is done by
      the `await()` method, which blocks until all threads have arrived at the barrier.

4. **Barrier Reusability**:

    * After all threads are released, the barrier can be reused in a cyclic manner (i.e., for future cycles if needed).

### Key Points:

* `CyclicBarrier` is useful in scenarios where multiple threads must synchronize their progress.
* It is a cyclic object, meaning it can be reused after the threads are released, unlike `CountDownLatch`, which is a
  one-time use.
* The `await()` method blocks the thread until all the parties have called it.
* The `CyclicBarrier` can execute an optional action (like printing a message or performing a task) once all threads
  have reached the barrier.

### Use Cases:

* Parallel processing where multiple threads need to wait for others before proceeding (e.g., when dividing tasks across
  multiple threads, but they need to synchronize at certain points).
