The N+1 problem is a common performance issue encountered when working with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools and
databases. It arises when an application needs to fetch related data for a set of entities, resulting in an excessive
number of database queries.

**Understanding the Problem:**

Imagine you have two entities: `Author` and `Book`. An `Author` can have multiple `Book`s.

1. **Initial Query (N):** You fetch a list of `N` authors from the database. This is your initial query.
2. **Subsequent Queries (N):** For each author in the list, you need to fetch their associated books. If your ORM tool
   is not optimized, it might issue a separate database query for each author to retrieve their books. This results in N
   additional queries.

In total, you execute 1 (initial) + N (subsequent) queries, hence the name "N+1 problem."

**Example (Conceptual Java/Hibernate):**

```java
// Assuming you have Author and Book entities, and a repository or DAO

List<Author> authors = authorRepository.findAll(); // Initial query (1)

for(
Author author :authors){
List<Book> books = author.getBooks(); // N queries (one per author)
// Process books...
}
```

**Consequences:**

* **Performance Degradation:** The excessive number of database queries can significantly slow down your application,
  especially when dealing with a large number of entities.
* **Database Load:** The database server becomes overloaded with numerous small queries.
* **Network Latency:** Each query incurs network overhead, further contributing to performance issues.

**Solutions:**

1. **Eager Loading (Join Fetch):**
    * Modify your initial query to fetch the related data in a single query using `JOIN FETCH` (Hibernate),
      `Eager Loading` (Entity Framework), or similar mechanisms.
    * This avoids the N subsequent queries by retrieving all the necessary data in one go.

   ```java
   // Hibernate example:
   List<Author> authors = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a JOIN FETCH a.books", Author.class).getResultList();
   ```

2. **Batch Loading (Lazy Loading with Batching):**
    * If eager loading is not feasible or desirable, use batch loading.
    * This allows the ORM to group multiple related data fetches into a smaller number of queries.
    * For example, it might fetch books for 10 authors in a single query instead of 10 separate queries.
    * Hibernate and other ORMs have configuration options to set batch sizes.

   ```properties
   #hibernate properties example
   hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size=25
   ```

3. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):**
    * Create DTOs that contain the necessary data for your use case.
    * Write custom queries that retrieve the data required for the DTOs in a single query.
    * This allows you to select only the required data and avoid fetching unnecessary related entities.

4. **Specific Database Queries:**
    * Sometimes, using a specific database query is the most efficient way to fetch the required data. This can be used
      if orm optimizations are insufficient.

**Choosing the Right Solution:**

* Eager loading is generally the most efficient solution when you know you will always need the related data.
* Batch loading is a good compromise when you need lazy loading but want to avoid the N+1 problem.
* DTOs are very useful for complex queries, and when the domain model is too large.
* Specific database queries are useful when ORM optimizations are not sufficient.

By understanding the N+1 problem and applying these solutions, you can significantly improve the performance of your
database-driven applications.
