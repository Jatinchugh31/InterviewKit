Hi, my name is Jatin.
I have 8 years of experience in the IT industry, primarily focused on building microservices-based systems.
I have  hands-on expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Quarkus, and both SQL and NoSQL databases.
In my recent project, I developed a complete KYC system from scratch and took ownership of multiple modules, leading
their design and development.
