Yes, exactly! In **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** (and also in **EKS** or **ECS**), you can define **different scaling policies** to automatically adjust the number of instances or pods based on real-time metrics. This helps your applications remain **responsive and cost-efficient**.

## 🚀 Types of Auto Scaling Policies in AWS

### 🔧 1. **Target Tracking Scaling Policy**

* Automatically adjusts capacity to maintain a target metric (like CPU at 60%).
* **Easy to configure**, similar to thermostat logic.

**Example:**

> "Keep average CPU utilization of the ASG at 60%."

✅ Best for: Most workloads — simple and effective.

---

### 📈 2. **Step Scaling Policy**

* You define **steps** — how much to scale based on thresholds.

**Example:**

> * If CPU > 70% for 5 minutes, add 2 instances
> * If CPU > 90%, add 4 instances

✅ Best for: Workloads that need more precise or aggressive scaling.

---

### ⏰ 3. **Scheduled Scaling**

* Scale up/down **at specific times** (e.g., traffic spikes during business hours).

**Example:**

> Scale to 10 instances every weekday at 9 AM; scale down to 2 at 6 PM.

✅ Best for: Predictable traffic patterns (e.g., office apps, training jobs)

## 🧠 You Can Say in an Interview:

> “Yes, AWS allows defining multiple auto scaling policies for EC2 Auto Scaling Groups. Depending on workload, you can use target tracking for simple metric-based scaling, step policies for fine-tuned control, or scheduled scaling for predictable traffic. These policies can be combined to create a resilient and cost-effective scaling strategy.”

## 🔄 Bonus: In **EKS** (Kubernetes)

You can use:

* **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** – based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics
* **Cluster Autoscaler** – adds/removes EC2 nodes when needed
* **Karpenter** – AWS-native intelligent autoscaler (for optimal node provisioning)
