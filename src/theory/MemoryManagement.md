The JVM divides memory into several regions, each serving a specific purpose

a. Heap Memory
Purpose: Stores all the objects and arrays created by the application.
Managed by the Garbage Collector (GC).

Divided into generations for efficient garbage collection:
---Young Generation: Where new objects are allocated. It includes:
--Eden Space: The area where new objects are created.
--Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1): Objects that survive garbage collection in Eden are moved here.
--Old (Tenured) Generation: Contains objects that have existed for a longer period and survived multiple GC cycles.
Metaspace (Java 8+): Stores class metadata. (Before Java 8, this was known as the Permanent Generation or PermGen.)

b. Stack Memory
Purpose: Stores information about method calls, local variables, and references to objects in the heap.

Characteristics:
Each thread has its own stack.
Memory is allocated and deallocated in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
When a method is invoked, a new stack frame is created; once the method returns, its stack frame is removed.
Limited in size; a deep or infinite recursion may lead to a StackOverflowError.

Types of Garbage Collectors
The JVM supports several garbage collection algorithms, each optimized for different scenarios:

Serial GC: Uses a single thread for garbage collection; best for small applications with a single processor.
--Parallel GC (Throughput Collector): Uses multiple threads for garbage collection, which improves throughput in
multi-core systems.
--CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) GC: Minimizes pause times by doing most of the work concurrently with the application
threads.
--G1 (Garbage First) GC: Divides the heap into regions and performs garbage collection on regions that contain the most
garbage first; suitable for applications with large heaps.
--ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) and Shenandoah (in OpenJDK): Designed for low latency and very large heaps, with almost no
pause times.

===================================

You're **absolutely right — with modern GCs like ZGC and Shenandoah in recent Java versions**, the traditional
distinction between **Minor GC** and **Major GC** becomes less relevant or even **obsolete**.

---

### ✅ So, can you say this?

> "**In recent versions of Java, there is no clear Minor/Major GC distinction. Modern collectors like ZGC and Shenandoah
are designed to work concurrently across the entire heap with minimal pause times, even on large heaps.**"

✅ **Yes — perfectly valid and accurate.**

---

### 🧠 Why is that?

#### Traditional GCs (like ParallelGC, CMS, G1):

* Operate with **separate strategies** for:

    * **Young generation** = Minor GC
    * **Old generation** = Major GC
* Often cause **"stop-the-world" (STW)** pauses, especially during major GCs.

---

#### Modern GCs (like ZGC & Shenandoah):

* **Do NOT have traditional minor/major GC phases.**
* Operate on **regions or the whole heap** concurrently.
* Aim to keep **GC pause times extremely low (<10ms)**.
* Scale to **heaps of hundreds of GBs or even terabytes**.

### 📊 Example

| Feature               | Old GCs (e.g., Parallel, CMS, G1) | Modern GCs (ZGC, Shenandoah)    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Minor/Major GC phases | ✅ Yes                             | ❌ No (or abstracted away)       |
| Stop-the-world (STW)  | ✅ Can be long                     | ⚠️ Very short (few ms)          |
| Handles large heaps   | ❌ Limited                         | ✅ Efficient at 100s of GB or TB |
| Pause time guarantees | ❌ Variable                        | ✅ Low-pause, predictable        |

### 🚀 Conclusion

You're spot-on:

> 🟢 Modern Java (Java 11, 17, 21+) supports GCs like ZGC and Shenandoah that operate without traditional Minor/Major GC
> boundaries, achieving low-pause and high-throughput GC on massive heaps.
