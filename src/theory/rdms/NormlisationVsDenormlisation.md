_**Data denormalization** is a database optimization technique where you intentionally add redundant data to a database
that was previously designed in a normalized form. The primary goal of denormalization is to improve **read query
performance** by reducing the need for complex and often expensive database joins.

To understand denormalization, it's helpful to first understand **normalization**.

**Normalization** is the process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data
redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables and defining
relationships between them using primary and foreign keys. This design aims to:

* **Reduce data redundancy:** Each piece of data is stored in only one place.
* **Improve data integrity:** Changes to data only need to be made in one place, reducing the chance of inconsistencies.
* **Simplify data modification:** Insert, update, and delete operations are less complex.

While normalization is excellent for data integrity and efficient storage, it can sometimes lead to **slow read queries
**. When you need to retrieve data that is spread across multiple normalized tables, the database has to perform "join"
operations to bring that data together. For complex queries involving many joins on large tables, this can be a very
time-consuming process.

**Denormalization steps in to address this performance bottleneck.**

### How Denormalization Works

Denormalization involves strategically reintroducing some redundancy into a normalized database. This can be done
through various techniques:

1. **Adding Redundant Columns:** Copying a column from one table into another table to avoid a join.
    * **Example:** In an e-commerce database, you might have a `Customers` table and an `Orders` table. `Orders` would
      typically have a `customer_id` as a foreign key to link to the `Customers` table. To avoid a join every time you
      want to see the customer's name with their order, you might add `customer_name` directly to the `Orders` table.

2. **Pre-joining Tables:** Combining data from two or more related tables into a single, larger table.
    * **Example:** Instead of separate `Products` and `ProductCategories` tables, you might create a
      `Products_Denormalized` table that includes all product details and category names in one row.

3. **Storing Derived/Aggregated Data:** Calculating and storing summary data that would otherwise require complex
   calculations or aggregations at query time.
    * **Example:** Storing the `total_order_amount` in the `Orders` table instead of calculating it every time from
      individual `OrderItems`. Or storing `total_sales_per_day` in a summary table.

4. **Mirrored Tables/Materialized Views:** Creating a copy of an existing table or a pre-computed result set (view) that
   is optimized for specific query patterns, often with additional indexes.

### Advantages of Denormalization

* **Improved Read Query Performance:** This is the primary benefit. By reducing the number of joins, queries execute
  much faster, especially for frequently accessed data.
* **Simpler Queries:** Developers can write less complex SQL queries as they don't need to specify many join conditions.
* **Faster Report Generation:** Ideal for analytical workloads, data warehousing, and business intelligence, where
  reports often require aggregated data from many sources.
* **Enhanced Scalability:** In read-heavy systems, denormalization can help the database handle a higher volume of read
  requests.

### Disadvantages of Denormalization

* **Increased Data Redundancy:** The same data is stored in multiple places, consuming more storage space.
* **Potential for Data Inconsistency:** If the redundant data is not updated consistently across all its copies, it can
  lead to conflicting information. This requires careful management (e.g., using triggers, application logic, or
  materialized views that automatically refresh).
* **More Complex Write Operations:** Insert, update, and delete operations become more complicated and slower because
  multiple copies of data might need to be modified simultaneously to maintain consistency.
* **Reduced Flexibility:** Changing the schema can be more difficult because changes might need to be propagated to
  multiple denormalized tables.
* **Increased Storage Costs:** Due to duplicate data.

### When to Use Denormalization

Denormalization is a trade-off. It sacrifices some write performance and data integrity simplicity for significant gains
in read performance. It's typically considered in scenarios where:

* **Read operations heavily outweigh write operations (read-heavy workloads):** Common in data warehousing, analytical
  reporting systems (OLAP), and applications with dashboards.
* **Complex and frequent joins are causing performance bottlenecks.**
* **The system demands very low latency for specific queries.**
* **The cost of ensuring data consistency through other means (like application logic or triggers) is acceptable.**
* **The data being duplicated changes infrequently.**

It's important to note that denormalization is not a replacement for normalization. A well-designed database typically
starts with a normalized schema, and then selective denormalization is applied to address specific performance
bottlenecks for critical queries._
