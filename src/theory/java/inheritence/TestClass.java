         ClassB b = new ClassB();
         ClassB c = (ClassB) a;  // this is valid because  class  because down casting  It is the process of converting a superclass reference back to its subclass type.

         // ClassB c = (ClassB) new ClassA(); error becuase we can convert parent class to child class;

         a.print();  // this will call parent class as there is no overriding

         //a is holding reference of class b so it is daynmic dispatching
         a.print2();  // this will call child class or parent class ?? answer it will call child class but why ??

         //This is due to dynamic method dispatch (Javaâ€™s implementation of polymorphism).
         b.print2();  // this overriding  child class will print
