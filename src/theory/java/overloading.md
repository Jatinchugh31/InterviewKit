🔁 **Let’s Recall Some Java Basics: Method Overloading!**

Quick quiz for your coffee break ☕:

```java
void print(long i) {
    System.out.println("long");
}

void print(Integer i) {
    System.out.println("Integer");
}
```

What happens when you call:

```java
print(5);
```

🤔 Most folks guess **"Integer"** — but the actual output is:
👉 **`long`**

Why? Because Java follows a clear method resolution order when dealing with overloaded methods:

1️⃣ Exact match
2️⃣ **Widening** (e.g., `int` → `long`)
3️⃣ **Boxing** (e.g., `int` → `Integer`)
4️⃣ Varargs

In this case, `5` is a primitive `int`. Since there's no `print(int)`:

* It prefers **widening** to `long` over boxing to `Integer`.

🧠 TL;DR:

> In Java overloading, **widening beats boxing**.

It’s one of those subtle rules that can save you from unexpected behavior in production code!
