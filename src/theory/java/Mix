we know the comman difference between stringBuffer and String builder.
as buffer is thread safe where builder is not
so it can impact the performance .

but can you tell any real time use case where we can use StringBuffer or where we can use StringBuilder .
one example is tranction bank, as in this we need to maintain consitnscy so it should be thread safe , only one can update at a time
