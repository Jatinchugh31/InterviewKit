node js  use java script based engine to process the  reques t

node js is good where large number of IO request involve and less complex logic 
becuase node js use async process for IO request  it is  goodd when io request 
like db or calling  some other service . 

logic should be IO bound not CPU bound

 single thread can handle the request so less context switching
