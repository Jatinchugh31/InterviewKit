remove duplicate from array and maintain order 
[1,1,2,3,4,4,5] [1,2,3,4,5,nul,null]

//  refere updateHashSet question  , we need to make class immutable , currently student class in not immutable 
// we have table select names, sum(marks) as tatal marks from student group by name order by toatal marks dsc; 

// print 1 to 10 in multiupule thread sequencial   ,   // refere printCounting.java

data stucture question like if we have csvfile    

and we need to store information so we query based on range  which data structure we will use 
TreeMap<LocalDate,List<Student>> map  = new TreeMap<>(Compartor.comapring().reverserOrder());

if we need to query on id but order will be maintain as csv file 
Map<Long,Student> map  = new LinkedHashMap()
