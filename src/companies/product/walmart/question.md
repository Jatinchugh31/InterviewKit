Quest1 :: 

/**
*
* From Bammidi Rakesh varma to everyone 09:07 AM
* You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins.
* The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
*
* Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
* Input: n = 5
* Output: 2
* Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
* Input: n = 8
* Output: 3
* Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

Question 2 :


/**
* Design a data structure that is initialized with a list of different words. Provided a string, you should determine
* if you can change exactly one character in this string to match any word in the data structure.
* <p>
* Implement the MagicDictionary class:
* <p>
* MagicDictionary() Initializes the object.
* void buildDict(String[] dictionary) Sets the data structure with an array of distinct strings dictionary.
* bool search(String searchWord) Returns true if you can change exactly one character in searchWord to match
* any string in the data structure, otherwise returns false.
* Input
* ["MagicDictionary", "buildDict", "search", "search", "search", "search"]
* [[], [["hello", "leetcode"]], ["hello"], ["hhllo"], ["hell"], ["leetcoded"]]
* Output
* [null, null, false, true, false, false]
* <p>
* Explanation
* MagicDictionary magicDictionary = new MagicDictionary();
* magicDictionary.buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]);
* magicDictionary.search("hello"); // return False
* magicDictionary.search("hhllo"); // We can change the second 'h' to 'e' to match "hello" so we return True
* magicDictionary.search("hell"); // return False
* magicDictionary.search("leetcoded"); // return False
