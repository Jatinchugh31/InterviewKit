Sure! Here's a clear and professional **LinkedIn post** comparing **Command, Strategy, and Factory patterns**, tailored for engineers and tech leads:

üîÅ **Factory vs Strategy vs Command ‚Äî Same Structure, Different Purpose**

Many design patterns in software look similar ‚Äî interfaces, concrete classes, replaceable behaviors. But they solve **very different problems**.

Let‚Äôs break down 3 popular patterns that often confuse developers:

---

### üîß **Factory Pattern**

> *‚ÄúCreate something.‚Äù*

* Used to encapsulate **object creation** logic
* Helps decouple instantiation from usage
* Great when the **type of object** depends on config, input, or runtime conditions

```java
Notification n = NotificationFactory.create("EMAIL");
```

---

### üîÅ **Strategy Pattern**

> *‚ÄúChoose how to do something.‚Äù*

* Encapsulates **algorithms or behaviors**
* Used when you want to switch logic dynamically
* Great for flexible, plug-and-play logic (e.g., payment methods, sorting strategies)

```java
context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
context.execute();
```

---

### üß© **Command Pattern**

> *‚ÄúTell someone to do something.‚Äù*

* Encapsulates a **request/action** as an object
* Ideal for **deferred execution, queuing, retrying, undo**
* Useful when different parts of the system (UI, scheduler, events) need to **invoke the same action**

```java
Command cmd = new PrintCommand(printer);
cmd.execute();
```

üß† **TL;DR**
They all use interfaces.
They all promote clean architecture.
But their **intent** is what sets them apart.

| Pattern  | Focus    | Role            |
| -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Factory  | Creation | What to build   |
| Strategy | Behavior | How to behave   |
| Command  | Action   | What to execute |
