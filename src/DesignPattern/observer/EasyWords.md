🚀 Understanding the Observer Design Pattern in Simple Words 🚀

Ever wondered how systems notify users when something changes? 🤔

For example, think of an online store that notifies you when your favorite product is back in stock. This is a classic
use case of the Observer Design Pattern.

So, how does it work? Let’s break it down! 👇

1. Subject 🎯:

The Subject is like the store’s inventory system. It keeps track of the product status (in stock or out of stock). When
a product’s availability changes, it needs to notify the people interested.

📝 Key responsibilities:

Register observers (users who want updates).

Notify observers when the product is back in stock.

2. Observer 👀:

The Observer is the user who has signed up to receive updates when the product is available again. They don’t do
anything until the subject (the store) tells them something has changed.

📝 Key responsibility:

React to updates (like receiving a notification that the product is back in stock).

How does the pattern work? 🔄

The Observer registers with the Subject (like a user signing up for notifications).

When the Subject changes its state (e.g., product is back in stock), it notifies all the Observers (sending them a
notification).

It's as simple as that! 😎

Why is it useful?

It helps in loose coupling. The Subject doesn’t need to know who or how many Observers are out there. It just notifies
them.

It's great for systems where multiple entities need to react to a change, but each entity can operate independently.

The Observer Pattern can be seen in action in things like:

Product updates

Price alerts

Event notifications

Bottom line: The Observer is the listener, and the Subject is the one doing the broadcasting. 🗣️🔊
