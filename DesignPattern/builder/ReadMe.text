builder design pattern we use where  we have multiupule properties ,
but all the properties are optional .  not required ,

so instead of creating one big constructor or  multipule argument constructor ,

We create a class using chaining and initilize the requred properties . and in the last we will call the build method .
common example is @Builder of lombook annotation


we can use builder design pattern to build complax objects
